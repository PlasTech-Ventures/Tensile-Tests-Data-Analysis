# Tensile-Tests-Data-Analysis
This repository is part of PlasTech Venture's material properties paper. We conducted tensile tests on mixed sachet/PP sample bars. We create stress/strain curves with our collected data and conduct other relevant analyses.

Our data is stored in excel sheet format. In our excel sheet, we have multiple sheets for each type of sample. In each sheet, we have 6-7 trials worth of data to collect. When conducting data analysis, it is important to have your data in the specific format that is shown in the files. This format consists of having a trial every 5 columns and having data start on the third row.
